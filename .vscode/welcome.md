Welcome to the Mautic End User documentation editor., open

Everything you need is already set up. To get started, follow these steps:
1. Open a file in the `docs/` folder - files that end with `.rst` are docs files.
2. Click the magnifier icon in the top right corner to see a live preview of the file you're editing.

Pretty cool, right?

Happy writing.
