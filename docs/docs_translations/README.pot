So if `tx pull proj.res` pulls from the `https://app.transifex.com/org/proj/res` resource, then `tx pull --branch foo proj.res` will pull from the `https://app.transifex.com/org/proj/foo--res` resource. This way you can separate the localization effort across different branches. If you supply an empty string as the branch (`--branch ''`), then the client will attempt to figure out the currently active branch in the local git repository. For example:"
