msgid "Please don't blindly manually install Plugins you see in the Mautic Marketplace, as they may not work with your version of Mautic. Always verify if they support your Mautic version before installing.

msgid "The list view allows you to search for specific keywords. It displays quick stats including Plugin downloads and how many stars it has in :xref:`Packagist`. It also shows the vendor who has developed the Plugin. Sadly, the sorting by columns isn't available at the moment because it's not supported by the Packagist API. It's planned to add this in a future release."
