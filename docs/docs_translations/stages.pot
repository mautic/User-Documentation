To avoid using the Stage while building it, set a future publish date and time. If you want the Stage to become unavailable after a certain time, set the date and time for unpublishing."

It's not possible to move a Contact to a Stage which has a lesser weight than their current Stage. For example if they're currently in Stage B which has a weight of 50, you can't move them to Stage A which has a weight of 25."
