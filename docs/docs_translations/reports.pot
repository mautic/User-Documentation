msgid "**Columns** - Select the columns of data that you want to appear in the table of data in the Report. Click the column name in the left column to have it show in the Report. You can remove a column from the Report by clicking on its right column. The column returns to its original position on the left side. For example, if you select ID, it refers to the **ID** for the parent data source Category that you selected earlier Contact ID, Email ID, Asset ID, etc. It's recommended that you include **ID** in all Reports."
msgstr ""

#: ../reports/reports.rst:111
msgid "**Order** - For sorting the data in the Report, select data Points. The available sort options are **Ascending** and **Descending**. To add multiple columns, click **Add Order**. For fields that use text, an **Ascending** order lists values starting with B after values starting with A and so on. For number or date fields, the higher the number or later the date, the lower on the list the row is. Descending order is the opposite."
msgstr ""

#: ../reports/reports.rst:115

msgstr ""

#: ../reports/reports.rst:117
msgid "**Filters** -  Filter the data using conditions and values. This allows the generation of very granular Reports. This option helps you to narrow down the data included in the Report. The data Points used for filters don’t have to be columns that appear in the Report table. A commonly used filter for any Reports that include Contact record data is Email Not Empty, which displays only identified Contacts in the Report. Additional use cases can include Contacts or items that match a certain value, events happening within a certain date range, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../reports/reports.rst:121
msgid "Setting the **Dynamic** option to **Yes** makes it easier for Users viewing the Report to change the data they see without actually editing the Report. Users can see the filter by opening the **Filters** drop-down from the top of the Report page."
msgstr ""

#: ../reports/reports.rst:123
msgid "**Group by** - Select the columns for which you want to group data. By default, Reports show all items individually. In many Reports, you may see the same Contact, Company, or item appear multiple times. To only see each record listed once, you can add a grouping based on some attribute for the record."
msgstr ""

#: ../reports/reports.rst:125
msgid "You can use Email or Contact ID to display a single row per Contact record. For example, you can group by **Contact ID** to view the unique number of Asset Downloads or Form Submissions for a single Form, instead of total Asset Downloads or Form Submissions, which could include duplicates."
msgstr ""

#: ../reports/reports.rst:127
msgid "**Calculated columns** - Select the function that you want to apply to individual columns. Calculated columns display count, average, sum, or the minimum or maximum values from a selected field. They're only available when using a grouping to show a calculation for that grouping. Continuing with the previous example of grouping by a Contact ID number or Email address, a COUNT calculation displays how many times that Contact record appears on the Report if not for the grouping."
