UTM tags
########

UTM tags are also known as parameters or short text codes. When adding these tags to URLs or links, marketers can track performance, create customised audiences, and analyze on website traffic from various sources. Marketers can also use UTM tags with Google Analytics to clearly understand the effectiveness of their marketing content and return on investment for marketing projects.

Key benefits of using UTM tags
******************************

With UTM tags, you can:

- Track the value of marketing projects and measure return on investment
- Get precise data about conversion and traffic sources
- Test the effectiveness of marketing content through A/B testing

Using UTM tags in Mautic
************************

To use UTM tags with Google Analytics where they appear in your Google Analytics Dashboard, you must install your Google Analytics tracking code on the resource you are linking to. This synchronizes with your Google Analytics Dashboard and records the UTM tags.

If you use a Mautic Landing Page, you must go to Settings > Configuration > Tracking Settings, and add your Google Analytics ID.

If you use a non-Mautic Landing Page, you must manually embed the Google Analytics tracking script on the third-party Page.

Mautic Users can automatically append UTM tags to all links in an Email or Focus Item. For other Channels, you can make the link trackable by including UTM values in the URL address. When a Contact clicks a link in an Email or Focus Item, Mautic records UTM tags and stores them in the Contact record. You can find the details on the Contact Event History overview. After recording the UTM tags, you can use them as filters in Segments.

You can use UTM tags to track Contacts who convert from Dynamic Web Content slots in Emails, and determine the source in Google Analytics or Mautic Reports. You can also use them as columns in a Report by selecting UTM codes as the data source.

The following table lists the Google Analytics UTM tags:
